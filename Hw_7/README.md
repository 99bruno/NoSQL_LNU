# Homework 7 Assignment

1. Implement a sample query from an array with different sample conditions. 
2. Implement array-length sampling queries.
3. Implement selection requests from an array with control elements
lazy sampling.
4. Execute requests to add new data to the array from the
using operators that check and do not check for the uniqueness of new elements.
5. Execute a request to remove elements from the array.
6. Execute the request to change the values of the array.
7. Implement two queries using regular expressions.
